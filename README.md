# Crazy-Diamond

**Crazy-Diamond** is a lightweight, modular debugger implemented in C++ designed for low-level control and introspection of program execution. It supports essential debugging functionality such as breakpoints, stepping, register and memory manipulation, and backtrace inspection.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Program Control**

  * Launch new processes
  * Halt and continue execution
* **Breakpoints**

  * Set breakpoints on:

    * Specific memory addresses
    * Source code lines
    * Function entry points
* **Stepping**

  * Single instruction step
  * Step into functions
  * Step out of current function
  * Step over function calls
* **Inspection**

  * Read and write CPU registers
  * Read and write memory
  * Print current source location
  * Show backtrace of current execution stack
  * Print values of simple variables

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* C++17 compatible compiler
* CMake â‰¥ 3.12
* POSIX-compatible OS (Linux recommended)

### Build Instructions

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Turtel216/cd-debugger.git
cd cd-debugger
cmake -B build -S .
cmake --build build
```

### Running the Debugger

Use the debugger on an example binary:

```bash
./cdb ../examples/hello_world
```

## ðŸ§ª Examples

The `examples/` directory contains simple C++ programs compiled with debug symbols to test Crazy-Diamondâ€™s features. Use these to explore stepping, breakpoints, and memory/register inspection.

## ðŸ“‚ Dependencies

Crazy-Diamond includes the following open-source libraries as submodules:

* [libelfin](https://github.com/aclements/libelfin) â€“ for DWARF and ELF parsing
* [linenoise](https://github.com/antirez/linenoise) â€“ for command-line editing and history

## ðŸ’¡ Future Plans

* Watchpoints and conditional breakpoints
* Scripting interface
* UI enhancements
* Remote debugging support
